1. This is a small project created using HOOKS, where user can look up the weather for a certain place using simple input field.

2. Weather information is fetched from the OpenWeather API using Axios library.

3. Using react router user can put a name for a place as URI parameter and application reacts to it and outputs appropriate weather information.
(E.g. website-url/Batumi would output weather information for Batumi).

4. Error handling is also present.

5. DEMO is hosted on github pages: https://mishabatsiashvili.github.io/ReactWeatherApp/. (Unfortunately feature #3 doesn't work on github pages because of it's limitations, to view this feature you can run the project locally).
